## Abstract:
I will build an AI to minimize energy consumption of a single server.
## Problem:
In 2016, DeepMind AI minimized a big part of Googleâ€™s cost by reducing Google Data Centre Cooling Bill by
40% using their DQN AI model (Deep Q-Learning). I will do something very similar. I
will set up our own server environment, and i will build an AI that will be controlling the cooling/heating
of the server so that it stays in an optimal range of temperatures while saving the maximum energy, therefore
minimizing the costs. And just as DeepMind AI did, our goal will be to achieve at least 40% energy saving.

## Results
We saved over 50% of energy
